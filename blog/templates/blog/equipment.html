    <p>Sadly I can't do a bicycle tour without a bike or equipment to go with it. What follows is a list of things I'm bringing for this trip.</p>
    <p>As I had some trouble actually finding out what things cost, for some reason nobody wants to put this number online,
        I want to give future tourers this information!</p>
    <p>I'm also going to state the price for all the items. Prices will be in American dollars
        (even though I bought a lot of things in Sweden, where things are a great deal more expensive than the US).</p>
    So don't see this as the definite cost to bike touring, but as a general rule of thumb.
    Also I should mention again that I'm not sponsored in any way.
